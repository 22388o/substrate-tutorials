# Exercises to learn substrate

## How to do an exercise

## What are the exercises

Each exercise exists on two version, on two branches: one for the exercise, with `ex/` prefix, one for the solution, with `solution/` prefix.


The `ex` version is really often just the `solution` with some part of the code removed and some instructions in the README and as comments.

They are designed to teach you how to use the multiple featurs of Substrate and some good practices, while discovering blockchain core principles.
